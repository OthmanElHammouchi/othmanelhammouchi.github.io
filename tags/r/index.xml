      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working a lot recently on organising the code I wrote for my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis into an R package to hopefully get it published on CRAN.

After many grueling hours of debugging segfaults, the package finally seemed to be coming together, but there was still one aspect I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get right: tracking progress.</description>
