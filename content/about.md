Hello there! My name is Othman. I'm a mathematician, data scientist and quant developer living in Belgium. I love using models and data to generate insights and value for the digital age.

I have a lot of experience working with the ecosystem of statistical and machine learning packages available in R and Python. I also know how to use lower level languages such as C/C++ and Fortran to implement numerically intensive calculations from scratch and provide them with programmatic frontends in the aforementioned scripting languages and/or a GUI. This can be necessary in cases where the existence of legacy models, regulatory constraints or bespoke model requirements prevent the use of off-the-shelf components. 

I'm also very passionate about visualisation and communication. The old maxim that 'a picture is worth a thousand words' rings particularly true in a big data setting which can push the limits of our human powers of imagination. It's important that decision makers and other end users of data products understand the essential aspects of the underlying model so that they feel comfortable acting on its predictions or analysis.

I'm also a big-time nerd (shocking, I know :sweat_smile:). I love playing video games and am the DM for my local DnD group, for which I also print and paint miniatures.
